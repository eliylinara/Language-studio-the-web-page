            <h2>WORKSHOP PUNCTUATING BREATH</h2>
			
            <p> A workshop on being creative for our German language learning students </p>
			
            <ul>
                <li>The act of breathing is an act of keeping time, each heartbeat is the striking of a metronome,
				and as we form words with our vocal chords, we punctuate silence with meaning. In this workshop,
				we will center the role of breath in poetic practice, particularly spoken word. </li><br>
                <li>Through meditative breathing and writing exercises, we will bring forth what’s been bubbling within.
				Sitting with these bubblings, letting them settle and fill into the form and vessel of the page,
				we will explore how we can find our individual and distinct voices as performers, to translate 
				what is on the page onto the stage.</li><br>
                <li>This workshop is open to participants of age 18 - 35, writing and performing in English.
				We also encourage participants who have yet to perform their poetry to an audience.</li><br>
                <li>This workshop takes place on September 2 and 3, 2023 at the Goethe Institut Library.</li>

            <h2>IMPORTANCE OF CHINESE LANGUAGE</h2>
			
            <p> A workshop on Chinese Language as a soft skill for the future of Sri Lanka </p>
			
            <ul>
                <li>COLOMBO : The contrasting traits of an individual is what construes the individual’s character 
				and personality. A vastly recognized and encouraged trait, in the cooperate and general lifestyle 
				of man, is the possession of a “soft skill”.</li><br>
                <li>Speaking to Colombo Times, Shaikib Hisham, a law student, said : “Soft skills” can be identified 
				as the traits and inter personal skills that characterize a person’s relationship with others. </li><br>
                <li>Sociologists may use the term soft skills to describe a person’s emotional quotient (EQ) as opposed
				to the intelligent quotient (IQ). Soft skills are built on the foundation of mutuality.</li><br>
                <li>It has more to do with who people are, rather than what they know. Amidst the prevalence of 
				an established number of contrasting soft skills, there prevails one that takes the spotlight 
				dominantly – The soft skill of “communication”. The ability to inter-relate with an individual
				is the foundation of any human relationship. It is a vast preponderance in the cornerstone of 
				humanity.</li>
